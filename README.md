# Crime Project 
## By: Luke Truesdale and Michael Hebbeln

What drives crime patterns in U.S. communities? Are economic conditions, such as unemployment rates and income levels, significant contributors? Does political leadership play a role in shaping public safety through law enforcement policies and priorities? This project investigates the relationships between crime rates, economic instability, and local governance by analyzing multiple data sources. The analysis is based on a 2018 crime dataset from Kaggle, which provides a foundation for examining crime trends across U.S. communities. To enhance this data, we incorporated unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and mayoral information, including political affiliations, from USMayors.org and Ballotpedia.org. By integrating these datasets, the project explores how economic conditions and political leadership influence public safety and crime rates in different regions across the United States.

This project aims to explore the relationship between crime rates, socioeconomic conditions, and political leadership across U.S. communities. By enriching the crime dataset with household income, unemployment rates, and mayoral data, we will investigate how economic and governance factors shape public safety. Specifically, our research questions include:
- Is there a strong correlation between economic conditions, such as household income or unemployment, and crime rates? Do communities with higher income levels experience fewer property crimes?
- How does political leadership influence public safety? Are communities governed by mayors with specific political leanings more likely to experience different crime patterns?
- Are there regional differences in crime rates? Which communities within the dataset show the highest levels of crime, and do these align with socioeconomic trends?
- What types of crime are most influenced by economic instability? Specifically, does high unemployment correlate more with property crime than with violent crime?
